# War2Mod
War2Mod open source version

can be compiled with MinGW GCC compiler (i used gcc 10.2.0)
or you can put those files to Microsoft Visual Studio and compile there (i used MVS 2019 and project was set with 144_xp build tools)

This files itself is just template. You must fill empty victory conditions functions in w2p.cpp before compiling.

Resulted mod plugin working ONLY for singleplayer campaigns and custom games.
It will not be compatible with war2mod plugin file from server. DO NOT use them together even in singleplayer. (because mostly one mod will overwrite another)
DO NOT join server with plugin compiled using those files - 99% game crash or drop - its for SINGPLEPLAYER use ONLY!!!
